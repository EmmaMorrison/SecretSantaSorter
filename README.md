# SecretSantaSorter
A sorting programme to pair two people together for Secret Santa

Just a little sorting function I coded from scratch :)

This version is run using Deno. [Click here for more info about Deno](https://deno.com/)

1. Create a plain text file, called `list.txt` with a list of name, one on each line.

2. The file name is passed in as an argument to the `parseList` function on line 12 of `main.ts` which will parse the list into an array of strings. 

3. The resulting array will then be passed into the `secretSantaSorter` function.

Merry Christmas!
